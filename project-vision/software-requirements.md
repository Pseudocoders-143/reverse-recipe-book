# Wire-frames & Software Requirements

**_*This is not binding; you will probably change your classes and methods as you go, and hopefully add to them as you enhance your software. But you should think long and hard about how your program will work, in detail. A good strategy is to start by writing out your algorithm in English -- every step of your computation so that a person reading it could do exactly what your program would do. I am not asking you to submit that, but I highly recommend that approach.*_**

_Continue to update your online document as things change, so that everyone on your team can see what the interfaces (method signatures, etc.) are supposed to be. If anyone needs to change one of the agreed interfaces, be sure to discuss this with your team before updating the document._

**You MUST describe what the non-functional requirement is and how it will be implemented. Simply saying “Our project will be testable for testability” is NOT acceptable. Tell us how, why, and what.**

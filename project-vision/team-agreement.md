# Team Agreement

## Cooperation Plan

_Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member._

**_Describe at least:_**

- _What are the key strengths of each person on the team?_

  - Rhea Carillo:
  - Dami Gesinde:
  - Hunter McDonald:
  - Mark Nazarenko:
  - Josh Paskett:

- _How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?_

  - Rhea Carillo:
  - Dami Gesinde:
  - Hunter McDonald:
  - Mark Nazarenko:
  - Josh Paskett:

- _In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?_

  - Rhea Carillo:
  - Dami Gesinde:
  - Hunter McDonald:
  - Mark Nazarenko:
  - Josh Paskett:

- _Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?_

  - The team has agreed to meet on ... between the hours of ...
  - Communication will be primarily through Discord. The Canvas group will also be used to share announcements.

**_NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here._**

## Conflict Plan

_Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary._

**_Describe at least:_**

- _What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?_

  - We will ...

- _What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?_

  - We will ...

- _How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?_

  - We will ...

- _How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?_

  - We will ...

- _How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?_

  - If the conflict is not resolved in a timely matter, we will ...

## Communication Plan

_Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up._

- ...

**_Describe at least:_**

- _What hours will you be available to communicate?_

  - Meetings will begin on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4:00 PM and end before class time.

- _What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone, …)?_

  - The team (Psuedocoders) has agreed to communicate through Discord.

- _What is your plan if you start to fall behind?_

  - Rhea Carillo: If I start to fall behind, I'll seek feedback from my team members and request code reviews. I will also seek opportunities to collaborate directly with my peers through pair-programming (where one person is the _driver_ and the other is the _navigator_). There's always a lot I can learn from others. If I need structured advice, I'll ask Matt for feedback.
  - Dami Gesinde:
  - Hunter McDonald:
  - Mark Nazarenko:
  - Josh Paskett:

- _How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?_

  - After hours and on weekends, we will continue to communicate through Discord.

- _What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?_

  - We will conduct a standup session at the start of work sessions to share what we've worked on as well as our current blockers.

- _How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?_

  - ...

## Work Plan

**Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.**

**_NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks._**

**_Describe at least:_**

- _How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?_

  - The team will use ...

- _What project management tool will be used?_
  - ...

## Presentation Deck

**_Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file._**

**Link:**

## Git Process

**Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.**

**_Describe at least:_**

- _What components of your project will live on GitHub?_

  - GitHub will house our source-code, as well as our project preparation documents.

- H*ow will you share the repository with your teammates?*

  - We have a GitHub Organization where we all have admin access to all repositories.

- _What is your Git flow?_

_Rhea note: Here's an example of a workflow a lot of my old team members used:_

    _- We will primarily develop and test our application within an aptly named `development` branch. Our `main` branch will host our final, and fully-tested production code. We will write and test the individual features, `classes` and `methods` within aptly-named Git branches. Code for feature branches will be pulled from the `development` branch to working on feature tasks._

- _Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:_
  - _How many people must review a Pull Request (PR)?_
    - ...
  - _Who merges PRs?_
    - ...
  - _How often will you merge code from pull requests into `development` and `main` branches?_
    - We wil merge...

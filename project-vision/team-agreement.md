- _What is your plan if you start to fall behind?_

  - Rhea Carillo: If I start to fall behind, I'll seek feedback from my team members and request code reviews. I will also seek opportunities to collaborate directly with my peers through pair-programming (where one person is the _driver_ and the other is the _navigator_). There's always a lot I can learn from others. If I need structured advice, I'll ask Matt for feedback.

## Work Plan

**Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.**

**_NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks._**

**Link:**

## Git Process

**Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.**

**_Describe at least:_**

- *What components of your project will live on GitHub?*

  - GitHub will house our source-code, as well as our project preparation documents.

- H*ow will you share the repository with your teammates?*

  - We have a GitHub Organization where we all have admin access to all repositories.

- *What is your Git flow?*

_Rhea note: Here's an example of a workflow a lot of my old team members used:_

    _- We will primarily develop and test our application within an aptly named `development` branch. Our `main` branch will host our final, and fully-tested production code. We will write and test the individual features, `classes` and `methods` within aptly-named Git branches. Code for feature branches will be pulled from the `development` branch to working on feature tasks._

- *Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:*
  - *How many people must review a Pull Request (PR)?*
    - ...
  - *Who merges PRs?*
    - ...
  - *How often will you merge code from pull requests into `development` and `main` branches?*
    - We wil merge...
